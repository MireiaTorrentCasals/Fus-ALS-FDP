# Fus-ALS Final Degree Project
This repository includes all the data and scripts in order to perform the single-nuclei RNA analysis for the study. 

The 4 sample files include the files generated by the CellRanger command of 10X.
In the FusdNLS_MyoDicre sample it is included an html file describing the quality of the sequence and a tsne projection regarding the total UMI counts for each cell-barcode and the projection of cells by Clustering. It is an important file in order to know if the flowcell is well sequenced or not.
